## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Amy Bee`.


* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Amy Bee t/friend` or as `n/Amy Bee`.


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies the fields to be in the order`n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, 
  arranging them in an alternative order such as `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.


* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
