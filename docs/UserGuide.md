## Managing your Minecraft friends

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Command format legend:**<br>

* You need to type in the words in `UPPER_CASE`. If they appear multiple times the last one will be taken.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Amy Bee`.

* Items in square brackets are optional. If they appear multiple times the last one will be taken.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Amy Bee t/friend` or as `n/Amy Bee`.

* Items with a `*` can not appear at all, appear once, or appear many times.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]*` can be used as `n/Amy Bee`, `n/Amy Bee t/friend` or `n/Amy Bee t/friend t/bestie`.

* The words you give can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies the fields to be in the order`n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, 
  arranging them in an alternative order such as `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extra words for standalone commands (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

contains the data of your previous Minefriends home folder.

**Q: What is the recommended window size?** <br>

The recommended window size is 1280 x 720 pixels, anything smaller may cause the UI to be distorted.

**A**:
As long as you want, however please note that the UI will be distorted if these parameters are too long.
