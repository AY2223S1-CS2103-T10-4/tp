## **Conceptualization of Minefriends**

#### Target user persona

A male 14 year old teenager who plays Minecraft multiplayer with his friends. 
He is an expert Minecraft player. He has school and extracurricular commitments 
but always finds time to play Minecraft. He plays a variety of multiplayer game modes 
(eg. creative, survival games, skyblock, KitPvP etc.) and he has different friends who play
Minecraft with him in different ways. He is familiar with Minecraft commands so he 
is comfortable with the command line interface (CLI).

#### Target user profile

* plays Minecraft multiplayer with friends regularly
* has many Minecraft friends (online and offline) from all over the world
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing to mouse interactions and types fast
* is comfortable using the Minecraft command line, and by hence extension, using CLI apps

#### Value proposition

There are many servers and multiplayer game modes in Minecraft, and players have different schedules to when they can play.
We want to help players find the right people to play the right game mode with at the right time.

#### User stories and use cases

The user stories can be found in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-user-stories) and use cases in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-use-cases).

## **Design of Minefriends**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Selected implementation details**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit a Friend

The "edit" feature allows users to edit details of their friends.

#### Implementation

The edit feature is facilitated through the `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser` classes. In
the `EditCommand` class, there is a `EditPersonDescriptor` nested class which takes in all
the updated details of the friend to be edited.

MineFriends will then call the "createEditedPerson" method which will create a new person
with new details. This will then invoke a call to the `ModelManager` class to set the new person
in the addressBook.

The following class diagram shows the organization of the classes for "edit".

<img src="images/editCommand.png" width="550" />

### Suggest a Friend

The `suggest` feature suggests a friend for the user to play Minecraft with based on a given
set of constraints. A detailed description of its usage can be found [here](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t10-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#suggest-me-a-friend-suggest) in the user guide.

#### Implementation

The class diagram below shows the organization of the classes of the `suggest` feature, with explanation provided after.

<img src="images/SuggestFriendClassDiagram.png" width="300" />

The `suggest` feature is facilitated through the `SuggestCommand`, `SuggestCommandParser`
and `PersonSuggestionPredicate` classes. Once parsed, every `SuggestCommand` will contain
a `PersonSuggestionPredicate` such that the predicate can be used to filter
through the list of all friends to get a list of suggested friends.

The `PersonSuggestionPredicate` is made up of two parts, a collection of `DayTimeInWeek` and a collection of `Keyword`. 
Minefriends will find all persons that is available for **any** of the `DayTimeInWeek` and contains **all** the keywords in 
the collection of `Keyword`.

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of the execution of the suggest command.
Some details related to the general parsing and execution of commands are omitted
as they have been explained under [logic](#logic-component).

<img src="images/SuggestFriendSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `filteredPersons` in the instance of `Model` will be filtered according to the `PersonSuggestionPredicate`
to contain only the friends who satisfy the predicate. More information about `Model` is available [here](#model-component).

#### Rationale for this implementation

Using predicates allows us to decouple the `SuggestCommand` and `Model` instances, by containing the logic
for deciding who to filter in a separate class `PersonSuggestionPredicate`.

In addition, the use of predicate allows us to exploit the power of Java streams, which makes it easier
to write simpler and cleaner code.

#### Alternatives considered

1. The `Model` instance can be passed directly to the `SuggestCommand` in which the `SuggestCommand` can
   modify the `filteredPersons` list directly. However, this leads to tighter coupling which reduces the 
   maintainability of the code.

### Autocomplete Commands

The "autocomplete" feature matches the current text to all the commands for the user when the user types in the command box.

#### Implementation

The autocomplete feature is facilitated through the `TextFields` class under the ControlsFX library.
The `TextFields` class provides a static method `bindAutoCompletion` that will create a new auto-completion binding between
the given TextField using the given auto-complete suggestions.

Everytime the user modifies the input, a `AutoCompletePopup` object, which is a `PopupWindow`, will appear below the CommandBox.
The object will display a list of suggestions that matches the current text in the text field.

Alternative implementations of coming up with our own classes were considered aside from using the ControlsFX library. 
However, coming up with the solution requires a great amount of effort for the same amount of functionality. 
Hence, the decision was made to use the ControlsFX library.

The following activity diagram shows the workflow for the autocomplete feature.

<img src="images/AutoCompleteActivityDiagram.png" width="750" />

### Display Friend Preferences and Socials as Tags

Whenever the user enters or modifies the in-game preferences or social handles of a friend, it is displayed as 
various coloured tags under the friend's profile.

#### Implementation

The display feature is facilitated through the `PersonCard`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonListViewCell` and `UIPart` class, 
and configured using the `DarkTheme.css` **FXML** file.

The `PersonCard` class inherits from the `UIPart` class, representing the panel that displays each friend's profile.
Its information is set by the `setGraphic()` method in the nested `PersonListViewCell` class in the `PersonListPanel` class. 

Inside the `PersonCard` class, there are multiple `FlowPane` fields, each representing a type of user preference.
Each `FlowPane` field is tagged with the **@FXML** notation, for use by **FXML** markup.

Everytime the user updates a friend's in-game preferences or social handles, a new `PersonCard` object is created. The object 
will retrieve the corresponding user information and add them as individual labelled tags under the friend's profile.

Each type of user preference is then tagged with a different colour, specified in the `DarkTheme.css` file, for 
easy differentiation of information.

The following class diagram shows the relationship between the classes in the UI system:

<img src="images/TagClassDiagram-0.png" width="550" />

#### Design Considerations:

#### 1. Which user information should be shown as tags?

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only in-game preferences (such as preferred game types and Minecraft servers) and social handles. 
  * Pros:
    * Strategic display of only the more important user details.
    * Less cluttered, cleaner user interface.
  * Cons: 
    * We have to decide which user details are of higher priority to Minecraft users, which may differ from user to user.
* Alternative 2: Show all user information as tags.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement as the format is consistent for all information.
  * Cons:
    * Too many tags displayed can make it harder to users to find the information they need at one glance.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### \[Proposed\] Amending Representation of Various Servers

The proposed representation of various Minecraft servers is in the format 
of `server name@IP address`. Each server can have duplicate names but each 
server will have a unique IP address.

#### Reason for Implementation
The current representation of Minecraft servers is in the format of solely 
an IP address e.g. `111.111.111.111`

This is much less user-friendly as compared to the proposed representation 
where users are able to remember various servers by their server names, 
and distinguish servers with the same names by their IP addresses 
e.g. `Mineplex @ 111.111.111.111`

#### Proposed Implementation

The server class currently only allows the server to be documented in the 
format of an IP address.

With the input `ms/ 111.111.111.111`, <br>
1) The `Parse` method in `AddCommandParser` will recognize the `prefix_minecraft_server`.<br>
2) The method will then call `parseServers` method of `ParserUtil`. <br>
3) `parseServers` method of `ParserUtil` will examine the validity of the 
server name by calling the `parseServer` method of `ParserUtil`. <br>
4) If it is a valid server name, a new server class will be created and 
added into the set of Server. <br>
5) The set of Server will then be an attribute of the new `Person` created.

![MSRepSeqDiagram](images/MSRepSeqDiagram.png)

Substantial changes will be made to the server class with constraints such as
validation regex being amended.

## **Appendix F: Effort**

If the effort taken to implement AB3 was 100, then the effort we put into Minefriends would be 150.

While we did not change the design and architecture that was laid out by AB3 drastically, we ended up modifying the 
behaviour of most of its commands, as well as adding many new and unique features to our software.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Redesigning the entire UI to fit the theme of Minecraft
* Redesigning the `Person` model to include Minecraft-related fields
* Redesigning the `Parser` to parse using regex
* Redesigning the `add` command to include more fields
* Redesigning the `edit` command to include more fields
* Adding a new command to `suggest` friends
* Adding and designing a help window to show the user a list of commands
* Adding the auto-complete feature to the command box

Amongst these changes, we had the hardest time redesigning the `Person` model, as we have encountered various bugs after
we have modified it to include additional fields, in the end we took many hours to fix more than 200 test cases related to it. 
Due to our iterative approach, we had to redesign other features to fit the needs of a redesigned `Person` model, which 
took quite a few iterations before we got it to a point where we felt comfortable with it.
